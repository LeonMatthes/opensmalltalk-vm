# Introduction

Welcome to the OpenSmalltalk-VM documentation.

This book serves as a way to provide you with entry points to get you started.
It does *not* aim to be a comprehensive reference.
More specific documentation can be found inside the classes and files that are linked from this book.

Depending on what you want to achieve with the OpenSmalltalk-VM, there are different areas that you might be interested in:

If you simply want to **build** the VM or troubleshoot problems during building, take a look at the [Build System](./build-system.md).

If you are interested in **improving the VM or its plugins**, you'll first want to set up a good development environment.
For this, see: [Creating your VMMaker image](./vmmaker-image-creation.md).
That page will also guide you through Setting up the documentation so that you can read and edit it from within Squeak.

After setting up your development environment, you can start reading:
- [Plugin Development](./plugin-development/plugin-creation.md)
- [VM Development](./vm-development/SUMMARY.md)
